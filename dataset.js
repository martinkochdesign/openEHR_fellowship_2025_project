Note: the corresponding ACTION time attribute for the 'Transfusion scheduled' step will record the time that the transfusion was scheduled into a system, not the intended date/time on which the transfusion is intended to be carried out;   --> 'Start date/time' is intented to record the precise time when the transfusion was started.

This is done by the recording of data against specific activities, as defined by the 'Pathway' careflow steps in this archetype.    This archetype is intended to be used for any type of medication and related order, whether prescribed by a health professional or available for purchase 'over the counter'. The scope of this medication archetype also includes orders for vaccinations, parenteral fluids or other therapeutic goods, such as bandages, nutritional products or other items that are applied or administered to have a therapeutic effect and which have a common pattern for data recording. Within the context of a Medication or Vaccination List, this archetype will be used to record only what medication or vaccination has been prescribed or administered.    Additional structured and detailed information about the activity can be captured using purpose-specific archetypes inserted into the 'Preparations details', 'Amount', 'Structured body site', 'Administration device' or 'Additional details' SLOTs, where required.    Timings related to medication management can be managed in one of two ways:  - Using the reference model - the time for performance of any pathway step will use the ACTION time attribute for each step.  - Archetyped data elements - the 'Original scheduled date/time' data element is intended to record the time when the medication item was intended to be administered. Note: the corresponding ACTION time attribute for the Scheduled pathway step will record the time that the clinical activity was scheduled into a system, not the intended date/time on which the activity is intended to be carried out.    In practice, some medications (for example, during resuscitation in the emergency department) will be administered on the basis of a protocol or verbal order and not be ordered in advance. The details about the medication will be added against the pathway step 'Dose administered'. For an ongoing course of medication, data about the medication item will be recorded against the 'Dose administered' step at each administration, leaving the instruction in the active state. When the last occurrence is recorded the ‘Medication course completed' step is recorded showing that this order is now in the completed state.    In other situations, such as secondary care, there may be a formal order for a medication item using a corresponding INSTRUCTION.medication_order archetype. This ACTION archetype can then be used to record the workflow of when and how the order has been carried out.    Recording information using this ACTION archetype indicates that some sort of activity has actually occurred; this will most commonly be the administration of the medication item itself, but may be a delayed supply attempt or another activity such as suspending the medication item in preparation for a procedure. If there is a formal order for the medication item, the state of this order is represented by the Pathway step against which the data is recorded. For example, using this archetype the progressing state of a Paracetamol order may be recorded through separate entries in the EHR progress notes at each 'Pathway' step. When documenting the reason for why an activity was performed or a pathway step was chosen, for example why a dose was omitted or the medication was ceased, the element \"Reason\" may be used.     When this ACTION archetype is used with the corresponding INSTRUCTION.medication_order archetype, information which hasn't changed from the order to the management activity aren't generally repeated in the action. It's considered good practice, though not mandatory, to record the medication item in the ACTION.    The pathway steps make a distinction between those which relate directly to fulfillment of the order, such as authorisation, preparation and dose administration, and those which relate to handling of the prescription such as issue, re-authorisation, dispensing. In some jurisdictions these are regarded as a single pathway, in others it may be helpful to handle order fulfillment and prescription in separate templates.    The names of most of the pathway steps in this archetype start with either \"Medication\" or \"Prescription\" to make it easier to differentiate between the pathway steps that are associated with prescription handling and those that are associated with handling the medication order itself.    In some jurisdictions, a prescription can be re-authorised for the purpose of continuing an ongoing medication order, while in others an entirely new prescription must be issued in these circumstances. In the latter, the pathway step 'Prescription re-authorised' is not applicable.", "misuse": "Not to be used for recording a medication order or instruction.

This is done by the recording of data against specific activities, as defined by the 'Pathway' careflow steps in this archetype.    The scope of this archetype encompasses activities for a broad range of clinical procedures performed for evaluative, investigative, screening, diagnostic, curative, therapeutic or palliative purposes. Examples range from the relatively simple activities, such as insertion of an intravenous cannula, through to complex surgical operations.    Additional structured and detailed information about the procedure can be captured using purpose-specific archetypes inserted into the 'Procedure detail' slot, where required.    Timings related to a procedure can be managed in one of two ways:  - Using the reference model - the time for performance of any pathway step will use the ACTION time attribute for each step.  - Archetyped data elements:  --- the 'Scheduled date/time' data element is intended to record the precise time when the procedure is planned. Note: the corresponding ACTION time attribute for the Scheduled pathway step will record the time that the procedure was scheduled into a system, not the intended date/time on which the procedure is intended to be carried out; and  --- the 'Final end date/time' is intended to record the precise time when the procedure was ended. It can be used to document the complex procedures with multiple components. Note: the corresponding ACTION time attribute for the 'Procedure performed' will document the time each component performed was commenced. This 'Final end date/time' data element will record the date/time of the final active component of the procedure. This will enable a full duration of the active procedure to be calculated.    Within the context of an Operation Report, this archetype will be used to record only what was done during the procedure. Separate archetypes will be used to record the other required components of the Operation Report, including the taking of tissue specimen samples, use of imaging guidance, operation findings, post-operative instructions and plans for follow up.    Within the context of a Problem list or summary, this archetype may be used to represent procedures that have been performed. The EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis will be used to represent the patient's problems and diagnoses.    In practice, many procedures (for example, in ambulatory care) will occur once and not be ordered in advance. The details about the procedure will be added against the pathway step, 'Procedure completed'. In some cases a recurring procedure will be ordered, and in this situation data against the 'Procedure performed' step will be recorded on each occasion, leaving the instruction in the active state. When the last occurrence is recorded the 'Procedure completed' action is recorded showing that this order is now in the completed state.    In other situations, such as secondary care, there may be a formal order for a procedure using a corresponding INSTRUCTION archetype. This ACTION archetype can then be used to record the workflow of when and how the order has been carried out.    Recording information using this ACTION archetype indicates that some sort of activity has actually occurred; this will usually be the procedure itself but may be a failed attempt or another activity such as postponing the procedure. If there is a formal order for the procedure, the state of this order is represented by the Pathway step against which the data is recorded. For example, using this archetype the progressing state of a Gastroscopy order may be recorded through separate entries in the EHR progress notes at each 'Pathway' step:  - record the scheduled Start date/time for the gastroscopy (Procedure scheduled); and  - record that the gastroscopy procedure has been completed, including information about the procedure details (Procedure completed).    Please note that in the openEHR Reference Model there is a 'Time' attribute, which is intended to record the date and time at which each pathway step of the Action was performed. This is the attribute to use to record the start of the procedure (using the 'Procedure performed' pathway step) or the time that the procedure was aborted (using the 'Procedure aborted' pathway step).", "misuse": "Not to be used to record details about the anaesthetic - use a separate ACTION archetype for this purpose.

This includes tracking progress from planning, via scheduling and delivery to completion, as well as deviations from the intended care path such as postponement or cancellation. This is achieved by the recording of relevant data elements about specific activities, each of which are described as the 'Pathway' careflow steps in this archetype.    The scope of this archetype deliberately encompasses activities for a broad range of clinical services, to act as a non-specific archetype for all non-complex use cases. Examples include, but are not limited to:  - self-referral by a patient for a check-up visit to a dentist for preventive care  - a series of visits to a physiotherapist for management of a musculoskeletal strain; and  - a referral from a requesting healthcare provider, such as a primary care clinician, to a receiving healthcare provider, such as a specialist, for the patient to receive a specific service, advice or care.    Additional structured and detailed information about the service can be captured using purpose-specific archetypes inserted into the 'Service detail' slot, where required.    This archetype may only be used in two ways:  - as a full record of the service that was delivered; or  - as a framework to record primarily the state of the requested service, with separate OBSERVATION archetypes used to record the actual test results for the delivered service - for example OBSERVATION.hearing_screening_result.    Timings related to service management can be managed in one of two ways:  - Using the reference model - the time for performance of any pathway step will use the ACTION time attribute for each step.  - Archetyped data elements - the 'Scheduled date/time' data element is intended to record the time when the service was intended to be carried out. Note: the corresponding ACTION time attribute for the Scheduled pathway step will record the time that the clinical activity was scheduled into a system, not the intended date/time on which the activity is intended to be carried out.    In practice, some services (for example, in ambulatory care) will occur once and not be ordered in advance. The details about the service will be added against the pathway step, 'Service completed'. In some cases a recurring service will be ordered, and in this situation data against the 'Service delivered' step will be recorded on each occasion, leaving the instruction in the active state. When the last delivery of the service is recorded, the 'Service completed' action is recorded showing that this order is now in the completed state.    In other situations, such as secondary care, there may be a formal order for a service using a corresponding INSTRUCTION.request archetype. This ACTION archetype can then be used to record the workflow of when and how the order has been carried out.    Recording information using this ACTION archetype indicates that some sort of activity has actually occurred; this will usually be the service delivery itself but may be a failed attempt or another activity such as postponement of the service delivery. If there is a formal order for the service, the state of this order is represented by the Pathway step against which the data is recorded. For example, using this archetype the progressing state of a referral request may be recorded through separate entries in the EHR progress notes at each 'Pathway' step:  - record the scheduled Start date/time for the referral (Service scheduled); and  - record that the referral has been completed, potentially including information about the service delivered (Service completed).    When the activities follow the usual Planned > Scheduled > Active > Completed states, recording a 'Reason' is not usually necessary - rather, it is usually used to record the reason for deviation from the typical care pathway.    Please note that in the openEHR Reference Model there is a 'Time' attribute, which is intended to record the date and time at which each pathway step of the Action was performed. This is the attribute to use to record the start of the service (using the 'Service delivered' pathway step) or the time that the service was aborted (using the 'Service abandoned' pathway step).", "misuse": "Not to be used to record data about activities carried out for activities that require a purpose built ACTION archetype because they have very specific data recording or pathway step requirements.

globally, including data on all units of blood products administered during the transfusion episode.", "use": "This archetype is used to record all or part of a blood transfusion procedure.    It represents the global capture of information about the transfusion process, i.e., the set or summary of all actions related to the administration of blood products during a clinical episode. It is not an EVALUATION archetype, as it does not represent a clinical assessment, but rather reflects the care process as it actually occurred, fulfilling legal and clinical requirements to document the execution of a prescribed transfusion.    Each administered blood product unit should be recorded using separate instances of the ACTION.unit_transfusion_management.v0 archetype, to ensure full traceability of each transfused product. This allows detailed and structured information to be captured for each unit (e.g., bag identifier, product type, transfusion start and end time, adverse reactions, etc.).    This archetype should be used to describe the transfusion procedure in an aggregated or global manner. It is especially useful when the overall process needs to be documented for legal, clinical traceability or reporting purposes. It is recommended to use it in combination with:    ACTION.unit_transfusion_management.v0, to document each transfused unit.    CLUSTER.transfusion_details (or similar), inserted in the \"Additional details\" slot, when more structured information is needed.    Date and time records related to the transfusion process can be managed in two ways:    Using the reference model: the time attribute of any ACTION instance indicates when the current state of the action was recorded (e.g., scheduled, started, completed).    Using archetyped data elements:    The “Scheduled date/time” element is intended to record the precise time at which the transfusion is planned to occur.    The end time of the overall transfusion process should match the end time of the last unit administered.    In cases where the transfusion of more than one type of blood product is prescribed (e.g., red blood cells and platelets), it is recommended to record a separate instance of ACTION.unit_transfusion_management for each product, as they are usually transfused separately and not simultaneously.    This main ACTION.transfusion archetype summarizes the complete transfusion process, in alignment with clinical practice, and can be complemented by individual transfusion actions to ensure comprehensive and traceable documentation of each component of the procedure.", "misuse": "This archetype must not be used to record the instruction for a transfusion. Use the INSTRUCTION.service_request.v1 archetype for that purpose.    It must not be used to record other types of transfusions (e.g., bone marrow transfusions [transplants], stem cell transfusions, immunoglobulin therapy, platelet-rich plasma [PRP] injections, or coagulation factor concentrates).    It must also not be used to record the intravenous administration of blood-derived products when the therapeutic intent is different from that of a transfusion in the strict sense —that is, the replacement of lost blood or blood components (such as in cases of hemorrhage) or the treatment of hematopoietic deficiencies. In cases such as immunoglobulin therapy, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), or other products used as medications, these products should be considered medicinal products and the appropriate medication administration archetype should be used instead.", "keywords": ["transfusion", "blood", "plasma", "blood products", "platelets"], "copyright": "© Departament de Salut de la Generalitat de Catalunya", "include": [{"code": "at0011", "label": "Additional details", "type": "CLUSTER", "archetypes": ["any_archetype"]}, {"code": "at0012", "label": "Adverse reaction", "type": "CLUSTER", "archetypes": ["any_archetype"]}, {"code": "at0017", "label": "Device details", "type": "CLUSTER", "archetypes": ["any_archetype"]}, {"code": "at0029", "label": "Requestor", "type": "CLUSTER", "archetypes": ["any_archetype"]}, {"code": "at0030", "label": "Receiver", "type": "CLUSTER", "archetypes": ["any_archetype"]}, {"code": "at0028", "label": "Extension", "type": "CLUSTER", "archetypes": ["any_archetype"]}], "exclude": [], "concept_name": "Whole transfusion management", "concept_description": "Procedure to transfer blood or its components from a donor to a recipient to replenish depleted blood elements.", "items": [{"code": "at0000", "label": "Whole transfusion management", "type": "ACTION", "description": "Procedure to transfer blood or its components from a donor to a recipient to replenish depleted blood elements.", "occurrence": ""}, {"code": "at0001", "label": "Item tree", "type": "ITEM_TREE", "description": "@ internal @", "occurrence": ""}, {"code": "at0003", "label": "Blood product name", "type": "['DV_CODED_TEXT', 'DV_TEXT']", "description": "The blood product transfused.", "occurrence": "1..1"}, {"code": "at0005", "label": "Number of units", "type": "['DV_QUANTITY']", "description": "Number of units of product transfused.", "occurrence": "0..1"}, {"code": "at0006", "label": "Unit volume", "type": "['DV_QUANTITY']", "description": "The amount of blood product contained in each unit.", "occurrence": "0..1"}, {"code": "at0007", "label": "Product location", "type": "['DV_CODED_TEXT', 'DV_TEXT']", "description": "The physical location of the product after delivery and prior to administration.", "occurrence": "0..1"}, {"code": "at0008", "label": "Description", "type": "['DV_TEXT']", "description": "Narrative description about the transfusion.", "occurrence": "0..*"}, {"code": "at0009", "label": "Total volume administered", "type": "['DV_QUANTITY']", "description": "The cumulative total volume of the blood product that has been administered.", "occurrence": "0..1"}, {"code": "at0010", "label": "Comment", "type": "['DV_TEXT']", "description": "Additional narrative about the activity or pathway step not captured in other fields, including details of any variance between the intended action and the action actually performed.", "occurrence": "0..*"}, {"code": "at0013", "label": "Scheduled date/time", "type": "['DV_DATE_TIME']", "description": "The date and/or time on which the transfusion is intended to be performed.", "occurrence": "0..1"}, {"code": "at0011", "label": "Additional details", "type": "CLUSTER", "description": "Further structured details of the action, possibly specific to a pathway step.", "occurrence": "0..*"}, {"code": "at0012", "label": "Adverse reaction", "type": "CLUSTER", "description": "Additional information regarding a specific adverse reaction event caused by exposure to a specific substance.", "occurrence": "0..*"}, {"code": "at0017", "label": "Device details", "type": "CLUSTER", "description": "Use to record details about durable or persisting medical device used during the transfusion.", "occurrence": "0..*"}, {"code": "at0002", "label": "Item tree", "type": "ITEM_TREE", "description": "@ internal @", "occurrence": ""}, {"code": "at0014", "label": "Transfusion identifier", "type": "['DV_IDENTIFIER']", "description": "Unique identifier for the transfusion, normally defined by the transfusion request.", "occurrence": "0..1"}, {"code": "at0016", "label": "Requestor order identifier", "type": "['DV_IDENTIFIER']", "description": "The local ID assigned to the order by the healthcare provider or organisation requesting the service.", "occurrence": "0..1"}, {"code": "at0031", "label": "Receiver order identifier", "type": "['DV_IDENTIFIER']", "description": "The ID assigned to the order by the healthcare provider or organisation receiving the request for service.

In many situations, a simple data element such as ‘Location of measurement’ or ‘Body site’ will be sufficient and practical when the value set is straightforward. This archetype is intended for cases where a more detailed or structured representation of an anatomical site is required, including precise or compound descriptions. It can be nested within relevant ENTRY or CLUSTER archetypes such as those for symptoms, findings, or interventions to support multiaxial or postcoordinated anatomical expressions. Examples include documenting pain in the lower limb, tenderness at McBurney’s point, or a laceration on the palmar aspect of the proximal right thumb.    The ‘Laterality' data element may be used to qualify whether a paired structure or region is affected on the left, right, or both sides. When involvement is symmetrical and equivalent on both sides, for example the same cancer in both lungs or similar pain in both legs, record 'Left and right’. However, when the clinical characteristics differ between sides, two separate instances should be used:    - Two parallel instances of this archetype within the same SLOT, each with its own laterality and specific details. For example, documenting equal tumours in the lower left lung lobe and the upper right lung lobe.  - Two parallel instances of the parent archetype, each containing an instance of this archetype, when there are clinically significant differences such as tumour type, size, or severity in each lung.    The 'Alternative structure' SLOT allows inclusion of additional archetypes that provide an alternative structure for describing the same body site, such as CLUSTER.anatomical_location_relative or CLUSTER.anatomical_location_clock, should this be required. In situations where this archetype is used to name a large or non-specific body part, the additional use of the CLUSTER.anatomical_location_relative archetype will support recording of a more precise location, for example, 2 cm anterior to the cubital fossa of the left forearm or 4 cm below the right costal margin on the chest wall in the mid-clavicular line.    If this archetype is used within other archetypes where the specified subject of care is not the individual for whom the record is being created, for example a fetus in utero, then the anatomical location will be identifying a body site on or within the fetus.", "misuse": "Not to be used to describe involvement of both sides of a paired structure when the clinical findings differ significantly between sides.

Use of the term 'medical device' varies depending on context. Within the Standards world, the term device tends to refer to mechanical or electronic devices that support healthcare and require rigorous documentation regarding location tracking, maintenance, calibration, software versions etc.  Within the terminology context the use of device is very broad, including any medical device that can be used in direct or indirect provision of clinical care, as long as it does not act in a way that exerts a direct pharmacological, metabolic or  immunological effect.    Examples of medical devices range from simple devices such as urinary catheters, tongue depressors, contact lenses, artificial joint implants, breast implants and plain dressings through to advanced devices such as artificial hearts, syringe drivers, spirometers, mobile phone applications and computerised devices that capture point-of-care medical measurements.     In the complex situation where a surgically implanted device is used as the means to deliver therapeutic agents such as chemotherapy directly into the body, this archetype will be used to record only the details about the medical device itself and the order for medication and details about the actual administration of the therapeutic agent will be recorded using specific medication-related INSTRUCTION and ACTION archetypes.    This archetype is designed to provide the framework for structured representation of any medical device and the data elements that are contained here are not specific for any one type of device. Single use devices will commonly require data elements such as Lot Number and Date of Expiry. In contrast these are usually not relevant for durable devices which will often have a set of identifiers, including a UID, Serial Number, Model etc.    Further, different types of devices will require specific information relevant to their purpose. This data can be recorded using specific CLUSTER archetypes inserted into the 'Specific properties' SLOT. For example: use of a urinary catheter may require additional details about the diameter and length of catheter, material composition, number of lumens etc.    If the medical device has a number of components that require recording of details, each individual component should be recorded explicitly by using an additional CLUSTER.device archetype inserted into the 'Components' SLOT.    The data field 'Software Version' allows for only a single version to be recorded. This is primarily applicable for a device which is a software application. If the device has multiple software or hardware components that need to be specified, this should be done by using an addition CLUSTER.device inserted into the 'Components' SLOT.    To record additional details for durable or persistent devices that relate to ownership, physical location tracking, maintenance schedules etc, use CLUSTER.device_details archetype inserted into the 'Asset management' SLOT in this archetype.

The qualifier may not be appropriate at another time or in another clinical context.     This archetype is designed to be included in Status SLOT in the EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis archetype. The intent is for the EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis archetype to hold all of the information that applies in all contexts, in contrast to this archetype describing only information that depends on the context of use.    IMPORTANT NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION:   - It is not intended or implied that any or all of these qualifiers should be used within the same context or period of time. In contrast to the usual design of archetypes, this archetype has been deliberately designed to collect a number of common qualifiers into one place in an effort to attempt some simple standardisation within a very messy area of clinical practice. It is acknowledged that the data elements contained in this archetype embrace many different, and sometimes even competing, concepts. This has been done mainly to prevent the need for multiple qualifier archetypes, each containing only one or two data elements.   - Some of these data elements are potentially directly conflicting if used simultaneously within the same context, for example it would not make sense to have an 'inactive' problem together with an Episode that is 'ongoing'. As such, these status qualifiers should be used with extreme care as they are variably applied in practice and interoperability cannot be assured unless usage guidelines are clearly defined within the clinical community in which the 'Problem/Diagnosis' and 'Problem/Diagnosis qualifier' archetype pair may be shared.     Full DRG coding will require the DRG-related data elements from this archetype in combination with data elements from other archetypes.", "misuse": "Not to be used to represent a differential diagnosis - use the archetype EVALUATION.differential_diagnosis for this purpose.

This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the following use cases:  - within INSTRUCTION.service_request or another laboratory-related INSTRUCTION archetype to describe a specimen that is to be collected, or to describe a specimen that accompanies a laboratory service request;   - within a laboratory-related ACTION archetype to describe specimen collection or a specimen that has been collected; or  - within OBSERVATION.laboratory_test_result or other laboratory reporting OBSERVATION archetypes to describe the specimen being reported.  In addition this archetype can also be nested within other ENTRY or CLUSTER archetypes, where clinically appropriate.    The level of detail in this archetype is likely to exceed that currently collected in most laboratories. It has deliberately been designed to cater for a simple, single specimen collection; simultaneous collection of multiple specimens with a single request; and complex situations where it is required to record minute detail about the preparation and subdivision of a single specimen.    The exact semantics of several elements of this archetype may change based on the context provided by the parent archetype in which it is nested. For example, the 'Collection method' element in the context of an INSTRUCTION archetype is the requested collection method, while the same element in the context of an ACTION archetype in the 'completed' state is the actual collection method.    Other complementary archetypes will carry the detail about 'Specimen container', 'Specimen preparation', and 'Specimen transport'.    This archetype has been designed to be used with the Specimen container archetype in two main ways:   - 'Specimen container' nested within 'Specimen' (for example when a venous blood specimen is divided between two vials, or a whole large intestine is divided into three buckets); or  - 'Specimen' nested within 'Specimen container' (for example when a bucket of formalin contains a section of large intestine and a rectum, or a jar contains five individually marked moles).    Please note: The term 'collection' used in this archetype always refers to the activity of obtaining a specimen from an individual. It is not intended to represent the transport of the specimen from the individual to the testing laboratory.", "misuse": "Not intended to be used for recording information about specimens that are not related to a specific individual.

It may be recorded by a clinician as part of a clinical history record as reported to them, observed by the clinician or self-recorded as part of a clinical questionnaire or personal health record. A complete clinical history or patient story may include varying level of details about multiple episodes of an identified symptom or reported sign, as well as multiple symptoms/signs.    This archetype has been designed to record the positive presence of the symptom or sign as part of history taking using OBSERVATION.story, or in conjunction with a positive response to OBSERVATION.symptom_sign_screening.    In the purest sense, symptoms are subjective observations of a physical or mental disturbance and signs are objective observations of the same, as experienced by an individual and reported to the history taker by the same individual or another party. From this logic it follows that we will need two archetypes to record clinical history - one for reported symptoms and another for reported signs. In reality this is impractical as it will require clinical data entry into either one of these models which adds signficant overheads to modellers and those entering data. In addition, there is often overlap in clinical concepts - for example, is previous vomiting or bleeding to be categorised as a symptom or reported sign? In response, this archetype has been specifically designed to provide a single information model that allows for recording of the entire continuum between clearly identifiable symptoms and reported signs.    This archetype has been intended to be used as a generic pattern for all symptoms and reported signs. The 'Specific details' SLOT can be used to extend the archetype to include additional, specific data elements for more complex symptoms or signs.     This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Structured detail' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.story archetype, but can also be used within other OBSERVATION or CLUSTER archetypes and in the 'Associated symptom/sign' or 'Previous episode' SLOT within other instances of this CLUSTER.symptom_sign archetype.", "misuse": "Not to be used to record screening questionnaire responses about the presence or absence of specific symptoms - use the OBSERVATION.symptom_sign_screening archetype for this purpose. However, this CLUSTER.symptom_sign archetype may be nested within the 'Screening details' SLOT in the OBSERVATION.symptom_sign_screening archetype if it is necessary to extend the questionnaire by recording details about symptom or sign.    Not to be used to record that a symptom or sign was explicitly reported as not present - use CLUSTER.exclusion_symptom_sign carefully for specific purposes where the overheads of recording in this way warrant the additional complexity.    Not to be used for recording objective findings as part of a physical examination - use OBSERVATION.exam and related examination CLUSTER archetypes for this purpose.    Not to be used for diagnoses and problems that form part of a persisting Problem List - use EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis.    Not to be used to record a formal and repeatable severity scale such as VAS or NRS.

This list can also be utilised as a source of up-to-date adverse reaction data for exchange or as the basis for decision support.     This list can include three types of archetypes that record the clinical data:  - positive statements about the occurrence of actual adverse reactions experienced by the subject during their lifetime are recorded using the EVALUATION.adverse_reaction archetype; OR  - a positive statement about the exclusion of any previous known adverse reactions can be recorded using the specific EVALUATION.exclusion-adverse_reaction archetype - for example: \"No known adverse reactions\"; OR  - a positive statement about no information being available - neither known previous adverse reactions nor known exclusions - can be recorded using the EVALUATION.absence archetype.    In addition a SECTION archetype can be included as an organiser that will suit local jurisdictions and clinical practice. For example: SECTION.adverse_reaction.    In order for this list to be accurate and safe to use as the basis for decision support activities and for exchange, this list should ideally be curated by a clinician responsible for the health record, rather than managed automatically by the clinical system through business rules alone.    While it is reasonable for clinically verified adverse reactions to be persisted over time, the same approach does not apply to statements about exclusions or absence. They should only be regarded as valid at that they are recorded. For example recording a statement that the subject is not known to be allergic to penicillin is out-of-date as soon as the clinician gives the subject a dose of penicillin and they react.    This archetype is usually managed as a persistent list, however there are situations where the list may be used within episodic care and require additional attributes such as context etc to enable accurate recording. The openEHR reference model currently only allows context to be recorded within Event-based COMPOSITION archetypes. As a result, this archetype has been modelled as an Event, rather than Persistent, COMPOSITION, to allow for flexibility so that some clinical systems can safely manage Adverse Reaction Lists for episodes of care, while others will choose to implement this COMPOSITION to act in a persistent manner.", "misuse": "", "keywords": ["adverse", "reaction", "allergy", "intolerance", "effect", "hypersensitivity", "side effect"], "copyright": "© openEHR Foundation", "include": [{"code": "at0002", "label": "Extension", "type": "CLUSTER", "archetypes": ["any_archetype"]}], "exclude": [], "concept_name": "Adverse reaction list", "concept_description": "A persistent and managed list of adverse reactions experienced by the subject that may influence clinical decision-making and care provision.", "items": [{"code": "at0000", "label": "Adverse reaction list", "type": "COMPOSITION", "description": "A persistent and managed list of adverse reactions experienced by the subject that may influence clinical decision-making and care provision.", "occurrence": ""}, {"code": "at0001", "label": "Tree", "type": "ITEM_TREE", "description": "@ internal @", "occurrence": ""}, {"code": "at0002", "label": "Extension", "type": "CLUSTER", "description": "Additional information required to capture local context or to align with other reference models/formalisms.", "occurrence": "0..*"}], "structure": "<details><summary>COMPOSITION[at0000] <span class=\"dict-label\">Adverse reaction list</span></summary><details><summary>category</summary><details><summary>DV_CODED_TEXT</summary><div><span class='dict-key'>defining_code</span>: <span class='dict-value'>[openehr::433]</span></div></details></details><details><summary>context</summary><details><summary>EVENT_CONTEXT</summary><details><summary>other_context</summary><details><summary>ITEM_TREE[at0001] <span class=\"dict-label\">Tree</span></summary><details><summary>items</summary><details><summary>CLUSTER[at0002] <span class=\"dict-label\">Extension</span> <span class=\"dict-occurrences\">0..*</span></summary><details><summary>include</summary><div><span class='dict-key'>archetype_id/value</span>: <span class='dict-value'>/.*/</span></div></details></details></details></details></details></details></details></details>", "structure_json": {"COMPOSITION[at0000]||Adverse reaction list": {"category": {"DV_CODED_TEXT": {"defining_code": {"433": "event"}}}, "context": {"EVENT_CONTEXT": {"other_context": {"ITEM_TREE[at0001]||Tree": {"items": {"0..* CLUSTER[at0002]||Extension": {"include": {"archetype_id/value": {"0": "/.*/"}}}}}}}}}}, "parent": "", "children": [], "auto-keywords": ["adverse", "reaction", "allergy", "intolerance", "effect", "hypersensitivity", "side effect"], "similar": ["openEHR-EHR-EVALUATION.adverse_reaction_risk.v2", "openEHR-EHR-SECTION.adverse_reaction_list.v0", "openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.adverse_reaction_event.v1", "openEHR-EHR-EVALUATION.absence.v2"]}, {"id": "openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.encounter.v1", "archetype_id": "openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.encounter.v1", "class": "EHR-COMPOSITION", "lifecycle_state": "published", "licence": "This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

This list can also be utilised as a source of up-to-date medical history data for exchange or as the basis for decision support.    This list can be comprised of three types of statements, each represented by specific archetypes:  - statements about the positive presence of problems, diagnoses or previous procedures are recorded using the EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis and/or ACTION.procedure archetypes; OR  - statements about the positive exclusion of problems, diagnoses or previous procedures can be recorded using the specific EVALUATION.exclusion-problem_diagnosis or EVALUATION.exclusion-procedure archetypes - for example: \"No significant problems or diagnoses\" or \"No history of significant operations or procedures\"; OR  - statements about no information being available - neither a positive presence of a problem, diagnosis or procedure performed nor a positive exclusion - can be recorded using the EVALUATION.absence archetype.    In order for this list to be accurate and safe to use as the basis for decision support activities and for exchange, this Problem List should ideally be curated by a clinician responsible for the health record, rather than managed automatically by the clinical system through business rules alone.    In a closed clinical system, it is expected that provenance of this Problem list can be managed through versioning of this COMPOSITION and its contents, with the additional option of a system-based audit trail.    While it may be ideal to have only one Problem list for each subject of care, it is more realistic to expect that in a distributed environment there may be multiple Problem lists for a single subject of care, each managed and prioritised for a specific clinician, episode of care or other context. For example, a Problem list for a primary care clinician may be a very different configuration to that which is useful for a specialist surgeon or for reference during a hospital inpatient episode. In primary care it is common to organise the Problem list based on active or inactive problems or diagnoses; specialists may prefer to see their list organised around primary diagnoses which are related to their specific speciality and secondary ones which are not; and an inpatient admission may include additional issues related to immediate nursing priorities that would not be relevant once discharged home - for these purposes there is a Status SLOT in the Problem/Diagnosis archetype, which allow use of an archetype that could support clinical systems to organise Problem lists according to the preference of the clinical users of the system, without perpetuating these contextual status labels to other clinical scenarios or for persistence.    This archetype is usually managed as a persistent list, however there are situations where the list may be used within episodic care and require additional attributes such as context etc to enable accurate recording. The openEHR reference model currently only allows context to be recorded within Event-based COMPOSITION archetypes. As a result, this archetype has been modelled as an Event, rather than Persistent, COMPOSITION, to allow for flexibility so that some clinical systems can safely manage Problem lists for episodes of care, while others will choose to implement this COMPOSITION to act in a persistent manner.", "misuse": "", "keywords": ["problem", "list", "diagnosis", "diagnoses", "procedure", "problem list"],

Alternatively, it may contain positive and explicit statements about known exclusions or absence of information about vaccinations. It is intended that the SECTION.vaccination_list archetype is nested within this archetype as design guidance for representing an Vaccination list.    The intent of this archetype is to be a generic container for any Vaccination list, which may have a specific context or limitation of scope set within a template. This list can be utilised as a source of vaccination data for an active current Vaccination list within a clinical system, for the transition of care, data exchange, or as the basis for decision support.     This list can be comprised of three types of archetype:  - statements about the positive administration of vaccinations are recorded using the ACTION.medication archetypes; OR  - a positive statement about the general exclusion of vaccination administration can be recorded using the general EVALUATION.exclusion_global archetype - for example: \"Never received any vaccinations\"; OR  - a positive statement about the exclusion of use of a specific medication can be recorded using the EVALUATION.exclusion_specific archetype - for example: \"Never received Hepatitis B vaccination\": OR  - a positive statement about no information being available - neither positive known administrations of vaccinations nor a positive exclusion - can be recorded using the EVALUATION.absence archetype.    In order for a Vaccination list to be accurate and safe to use as the basis for decision support activities and for exchange, this Vaccination list should ideally be curated by a clinician responsible for the health record, rather than managed automatically by the clinical system through business rules alone.    In local systems it is possible to generate a list of vaccinations by querying the database for all ACTION.medication archetypes that have been used to record each vaccination. However this list is useful to support exchange of a local Vaccination list with other healthcare.    This archetype is intended to be represented and managed as a persistent list, however there are situations where the list may be used within episodic care and require additional attributes such as context etc to enable accurate recording. The openEHR reference model currently only allows context to be recorded within Event-based COMPOSITION archetypes. As a result, this archetype has been modelled as an Event, rather than Persistent, COMPOSITION, to allow for flexibility so that some clinical systems can safely manage Vaccination lists for episodes of care, while others will choose to implement this COMPOSITION to act in a persistent manner.", "misuse": "Not to be used to record lists of Medications that are not intended for persistence and ongoing revision and curation - use COMPOSITION.medication_list for this purpose.", "keywords": ["vaccination", "immunisation", "list"], "copyright": "© openEHR Foundation", "include": [{"code": "at0005", "label": "Extension", "type": "CLUSTER", "archetypes": ["any_archetype"]}], "exclude": [], "concept_name": "Vaccination list", "concept_description": "A persistent and managed list of vaccinations that have been administered to an individual over time.", "items": [{"code": "at0000", "label": "Vaccination list", "type": "COMPOSITION", "description": "A persistent and managed list of vaccinations that have been administered to an individual over time.", "occurrence": ""}, {"code": "at0004", "label": "Tree", "type": "ITEM_TREE", "description": "@ internal @", "occurrence": ""}, {"code": "at0005", "label": "Extension", "type": "CLUSTER", "description": "Additional information required to capture local context or to align with other reference models/formalisms.", "occurrence": "0..*"}], "structure": "<details><summary>COMPOSITION[at0000] <span class=\"dict-label\">Vaccination list</span></summary><details><summary>category</summary><details><summary>DV_CODED_TEXT</summary><div><span class='dict-key'>defining_code</span>: <span class='dict-value'>[openehr::433]</span></div></details></details><details><summary>context</summary><details><summary>EVENT_CONTEXT</summary><details><summary>other_context</summary><details><summary>ITEM_TREE[at0004] <span class=\"dict-label\">Tree</span></summary><details><summary>items</summary><details><summary>CLUSTER[at0005] <span class=\"dict-label\">Extension</span> <span class=\"dict-occurrences\">0..*</span></summary><details><summary>include</summary><div><span class='dict-key'>archetype_id/value</span>: <span class='dict-value'>/.*/</span></div></details></details></details></details></details></details></details></details>", "structure_json": {"COMPOSITION[at0000]||Vaccination list": {"category": {"DV_CODED_TEXT": {"defining_code": {"433": "event"}}}, "context": {"EVENT_CONTEXT": {"other_context": {"ITEM_TREE[at0004]||Tree": {"items": {"0..* CLUSTER[at0005]||Extension": {"include": {"archetype_id/value": {"0": "/.*/"}}}}}}}}}}, "parent": "", "children": [], "auto-keywords": ["vaccination", "immunisation", "list"], "similar": ["openEHR-EHR-SECTION.immunisation_list.v0"]}, {"id": "openEHR-EHR-EVALUATION.absence.v2", "archetype_id": "openEHR-EHR-EVALUATION.absence.v2", "class": "EHR-EVALUATION", "lifecycle_state": "published", "licence": "This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

This archetype has been developed specifically for the use case where a clinician is preparing an extract from a health record, so that the receiver has explicit and unambiguous understanding of the information available - that which is present, excluded or just not available. It is primarily intended to be used within SLOTS in persistent COMPOSITIONS such as 'Therapeutic precautions', 'Medication list', 'Problem list', or 'Adverse reaction list'.

This archetype is intended to provide a single place within the health record to document the propensity for the full range of reactions, from trivial to life-threatening:  - immune-mediated: Types I-IV (including allergic reactions and hypersensitivities); or   - non-immune-mediated: including pseudo-allergic reactions, side effects, intolerances, and drug toxicities.  In clinical practice distinguishing between immune-mediated and non-immune-mediated reactions can be difficult. Identification of the type of reaction is not a proxy for seriousness or risk of harm to the patient.    Where a propensity is identified, information or evidence about one or more reaction events can be recorded using the CLUSTER.adverse_reaction_event archetype in the 'Reaction event summary' SLOT.    Identification of the severity of the manifestation of the reaction, recorded in the CLUSTER.adverse_reaction_event archetype, can inform the 'Criticality' of the adverse reaction risk. For example, experiencing anaphylaxis on first exposure to a substance would warrant setting a 'Criticality' of 'high', due to the high risk that anaphylaxis is likely to recur on second and subsequent exposures.    This archetype has been designed to allow the recording of information about a specific substance (amoxycillin, oysters, or bee sting venom) or, alternatively, a class of substance (e.g. Penicillins). If a class of substance is recorded, identification of the exact substance can be recorded on a per-reaction basis using the CLUSTER.adverse_reaction_event archetype.    Use to record information about the positive presence of the risk of an adverse reaction:  - to support the direct clinical care of an individual;   - as part of a managed adverse reaction or allergy/intolerance list;   - to support the exchange of information about the propensity and events related to adverse reactions;   - to inform adverse reaction reporting; and   - to assist with computerised knowledge-based activities such as clinical decision support and alerts.    The risk of an adverse reaction event or manifestation must always propose a causative substance or class of substance. If there is a degree of uncertainty that a specific substance is the cause, the level of uncertainty can be recorded using the ‘Verification status’ data element. If more than one possible substance may have caused a reaction/manifestation, each substance should be recorded using a separate instance of this adverse reaction risk archetype with the ‘Verification status’ set to an initial state of ‘Unconfirmed’ so that adverse reaction checking can be activated in clinical systems. If the substance is later proven not to be causal then the ‘Verification status’ can be modified to ‘Refuted’ - for example, after allergy testing.", "misuse": "Not to be used for recording physiological reactions to physical agents, such as heat, cold, sunlight, vibration, exercise activity, by infectious agents or food contaminants. Use a specific archetype for EVALUATION.problem/diagnosis or CLUSTER.symptom/sign for this purpose.    Not to be used to record adverse events, including failures of clinical process, interventions or products. For example: abnormal use, incorrect dosage or maladministration of an agent or substance; mislabelling; harm or injury caused by an intervention or procedure; overdose/poisoning etc. Use a specific archetype for the purpose.     Not to be used to record an adverse reaction where the substance is unknown.

Ethnicity is a concept that is frequently used inconsistently, such that existing or legacy data may be quite varied in content, including but not limited to:  - A long-shared history (written or oral);  - A cultural tradition, including family, social and religious customs;  - A common geographic origin;  - A common language; or  - A minority or distinct group within the local community context.    In designing this archetype, the structure has deliberately been kept simple, to support any and all requirements for representing ethnicity. As the understanding around ethnicity and appropriate value sets are identified and agreed upon, this archetype may grow to support evolving clarity of requirements. The data element 'Ethnicity' allows multiple occurrences so that more than one ethnic and cultural identity to be recorded for the individual from a single value set, and also so that more than one representation of 'Ethnicity' can be recorded, for example explicitly recording First People status.    The 'Ancestry' data element has also been included to support health risk assessment related to family history and inherited disease, such as a genetic variations that increase the risk of Crohn's disease in Ashkenazi Jews.     The amount of overlap between 'Ethnicity' and 'Ancestry may vary enormously between individuals, but separating each into distinct data elements will allow appropriate usage within the clinical context for decision support and provision of healthcare.    This archetype has been designed to be recorded as a single instance within a health record, persisted, updated and revised over time as a new version.    Ethnicity is often considered as a component of a demographic record for an individual however it has been represented within this clinical archetype for situations when it needs to be represented in a clinical data collection or is required to support culturally sensitive and appropriate healthcare delivery, for example in First Nations communities.    The concept of categorisation by race or skin colour is controversial. In some places, the term 'race' may be considered acceptable and interchangeable with 'ethnicity', yet is illegal in others. Contributing to the confusion, many value sets for ethnicity also contain values that describe physical characteristics such as skin colour or geographical origin. The concept of 'Race' may sometimes be used as a clumsy proxy for identifying risk factors related to social determinants of health (SDOH), however it is strongly recommended that archetypes that represent SDOH concepts be used for more accurate data capture.", "misuse": "Not to be used to represent the 'Country of birth' of an individual.

This information may be used to contribute to the identification of a current health problem, assessment of future risk from familial problems or conditions, or to initiate preventive health activities.    Traditionally the scope of family history has been focused on genetic factors or biomarkers as indicators of risk or potential risk. The scope of this archetype includes both recording of problems or diagnoses that have an inheritable origin as well as those that are not directly inheritable but influenced by the domestic setting, including psychosocial or environmental factors. Examples include exposure to toxins in the family environment, domestic violence, sexual abuse, alcoholism and other addictions.    Non-genetic family members can include adopted or long term fostered children, those related by marriage, or other unrelated individuals who participate in the regular life and influence of the family.    This archetype has been designed to include:  - a narrative overview as free text. This will allow family history details from existing systems to be incorporated as non-structured text; and  - a detailed area focusing on relevant health details about specific family members, including their medical history and biomarkers.    This archetype can be used within many contexts. For example, recording a family history entry within a clinical consultation; populating a Family History List; or to provide a summary statement within a Discharge Summary document.    Additional detail about a family member's specific problem, diagnosis or past procedures can be captured using the EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis or the ACTION.procedure archetype and specifying the 'Subject of Care' as the family member, rather than the subject of the health record.     This archetype can be used as the basis for a Family Pedigree chart of health problems/diagnoses or to support estimations of risk of a condition based on prevalence in the family history or known biomarkers.    It may be necessary to identify each family member specifically and not just by the relationship to the patient. For example, while there will be only one maternal grandmother, there may be many female maternal cousins. This may be required to ensure that a pedigree chart is accurate. It will also enable accurate amendments to the record for each identified family member. If the record is private and will not be shared, for reasons of clarity it may be preferable to record the relative's actual name. If the record, or part of the record, is to be shared, it may be more appropriate for the family member to be identified by a unique label or alias.", "misuse": "Not to be used to record information about the relative or absolute risk of developing a condition due to family history - use the EVALUATION.health_risk archetype, including the CLUSTER.family_prevalence for details about the affected ratio of family members.

The intended scope of a health problem is deliberately kept loose in the context of clinical documentation, so as to capture any real or perceived concerns that may adversely affect an individual's wellbeing to any degree. A health problem may be identified by the individual, a carer or a healthcare professional. However, a diagnosis is additionally defined based on objective clinical criteria, and usually determined only by a healthcare professional.", "use": "Use for recording details about a single, identified health problem or diagnosis.     Clear definitions that enable differentiation between a 'problem' and a 'diagnosis' are almost impossible in practice - we cannot reliably tell when a problem should be regarded as a diagnosis. When diagnostic or classification criteria are successfully met, then we can confidently call the condition a formal diagnosis, but prior to these conditions being met and while there is supportive evidence available, it can also be valid to use the term 'diagnosis'. The amount of supportive evidence required for the label of diagnosis is not easy to define and in reality probably varies from condition to condition. Many standards committees have grappled with this definitional conundrum for years without clear resolution.    For the purposes of clinical documentation with this archetype, problem and diagnosis are regarded as a continuum, with increasing levels of detail and supportive evidence usually providing weight towards the label of 'diagnosis'. In this archetype it is not neccessary to classify the condition as a 'problem' or 'diagnosis'. The data requirements to support documentation of either are identical, with additional data structure required to support inclusion of the evidence if and when it becomes available. Examples of problems include: the individual's expressed desire to lose weight, but without a formal diagnosis of Obesity; or a relationship problem with a family member. Examples of formal diagnoses would include a cancer that is supported by historical information, examination findings, histopathological findings, radiological findings and meets all requirements for known diagnostic criteria. In practice, most problems or diagnoses do not sit at either end of the problem-diagnosis spectrum, but somewhere in between.    This archetype can be used within many contexts. For example, recording a problem or a clinical diagnosis during a clinical consultation; populating a persistent Problem List; or to provide a summary statement within a Discharge Summary document.    In practice, clinicians use many context-specific qualifiers such as past/present, primary/secondary, active/inactive, admission/discharge etc. The contexts can be location-, specialisation-, episode- or workflow-specific, and these can cause confusion or even potential safety issues if perpetuated in Problem Lists or shared in documents that are outside of the original context. These qualifiers can be archetyped separately and included in the ‘Status’ slot, because their use varies in different settings. It is expected that these will be used mostly within the appropriate context and not shared out of that context without clear understanding of potential consequences. For example, a primary diagnosis to one clinician may be a secondary one to another specialist; an active problem can become inactive (or vice versa) and this can impact the safe use of clinical decision support. In general these qualifiers should be applied locally within the context of the clinical system, and in practice these statuses should be manually curated by clinicians to ensure that lists of Current/Past, Active/Inactive or Primary/Secondary Problems are clinically accurate.     This archetype will be used as a component within the Problem Oriented Medical Record as described by Larry Weed. Additional archetypes, representing clinical concepts such as condition as an overarching organiser for diagnoses etc, will need to be developed to support this approach.    In some situations, it may be assumed that identification of a diagnosis fits only within the expertise of physicians, but this is not the intent for this archetype. Diagnoses can be recorded using this archetype by any healthcare professional.", "misuse": "Not to be used to record symptoms as described by the individual - use the CLUSTER.symptom archetype, usually within the OBSERVATION.story archetype.    Not to be used to record examination findings - use the family of examination-related CLUSTER archetypes, usually nested within the OBSERVATION.exam archetype.    Not to be used to record laboratory test results or related diagnoses, for example pathological diagnoses - use an appropriate archetype from the laboratory family of OBSERVATION archetypes.

In an effort to clarify the phrases and intent, this archetype contains two data elements:  - The first, 'Contact type', to document the administrative type of healthcare sought or required - for example the type of consultation, emergency care, pre-operative assessment, routine antenatal visit or elective admission. This data element reflects the administrative category of care provision. Use of the phrase 'Contact type', rather than 'Reason for encounter' or 'Reason for visit' reflects the increasing trend towards alternative methods of healthcare provision that may not result in face-to-face contact between the healthcare provider and patient within a consulting room.  - The second, 'Presenting problem', to document the clinical reasons for healthcare contact. Chief complaint is regarded as a synonym for 'Presenting problem'. These are intended mainly to capture the patient's perceived issues or symptoms which have triggered them to seek healthcare advice, such as desire to quit smoking, stress, shortness of breath, genetic counselling or abdominal pain.

It is intended to be used for any type of medication and related order, whether prescribed by a health professional or available for purchase 'over the counter'. The scope of this medication archetype also includes orders for vaccinations, parenteral fluids or other therapeutic goods, such as bandages, nutritional products or other items that are applied or administered to have a therapeutic effect and which have a common pattern for data recording.    This archetype is designed to be used in a number of clinical contexts, including but not limited to:  - a record in a clinical consultation (COMPOSITION.encounter);  - a written prescription by a physician, dentist, nurse practitioner, or other designated health professional for a medication or nutritional product to be dispensed and administered (within a COMPOSITION.prescription);  - an item in a current medication list, prescription or drug chart (within COMPOSITION.medication_list); and  - an item in a summary document such as transfer of care (COMPOSITION.transfer_summary) or a referral (COMPOSITION.request).    In many cases a medication order will be simple – typically for a single medication item with uncomplicated instructions for dispensing and administration. However this archetype is also designed to allow for more complex therapeutic orders. For example:    - a reducing dose of prednisolone over a period of weeks;  - titration of insulin, with dosing dependent on test results;  - multiple medications prescribed simultaneously as part of a single drug regimen, such as a triple therapy for peptic ulcer; and  - intravenous administration of medications or nutrition supplements, including parenteral nutrition.    The archetype has therefore been designed to allow for a range of complexity, from:  - simple narrative instructions for orders like 'furosemide 40mg two tablets in the morning and one at lunch' to ensure compatibility with existing systems; and  - the amount of medication is usually represented in terms of a number and corresponding dose unit, however there can alternatively be a narrative statement to ensure compatibility with existing systems and coverage of all clinical scenarios; through to  - structured detail for dose, route and timing to represent a fully computable specification.    It has also been designed so that a single medication order structure can represent:  - complex sequential medication orders using the same preparation strength to be supported within a single order structure; and  - multiple medication orders can be chained in circumstances where different medications or preparations need to be given sequentially.    This archetype is also suitable for ordering parenteral fluids, in care settings where it is normal practice to make these 'prescribable' items. In other settings a separate 'parenteral fluid order' may be appropriate.    SLOTs containing CLUSTER archetypes have been used to represent some of the content for three reasons:  - To ensure a core archetype that can be used for all the above use cases, yet allow flexibility where it is required, for example the ‘Preparation details’ SLOT where additional structured detail can be added. A candidate archetype has been suggested for Medications. It is possible that other CLUSTER archetypes may be required in future for other purposes such as complex parenteral nutrition orders;  - to support archetype re-use in situations where the content has been identified as being also used in other clinical contexts, in particular the paired ACTION.medication archetype for recording actual dispensing, administration etc; and  - to remove less commonly used content from the core archetype framework.    Multiple orders can be represented as separate activities within this single archetype instance to carry tightly bound orders of different medications, for example, H. pylori therapy when this is not prescribed as a single pack.    It should be noted that these uses subsume both the FHIR Medication Order and Medication Statement use cases. i.e this archetype is a match for both FHIR resources, used in the appropriate context.", "misuse": "Not to be used to record the activities related to carrying out the order for medication, vaccine, nutritional product or therapeutic item, such as details about actual administration or dispensing.

This generic archetype has been designed as a framework that can be used as the basis for a wide range of requests:  - a request from one clinician, organisation or agency to another clinician, organisation or agency for a health-related service. For example: a referral to a specialist clinician for treatment or a second clinical opinion; transfer of care to an emergency department; four hourly vital signs monitoring; diagnostic investigations; and provision of home services from a municipal council; or  - a request for a follow-up service to be scheduled for the same clinician, organisation or agency. For example: an outpatient appointment for review in 6 weeks.     It can be used to represent a request for one or more services, in one of two ways:  - If multiple services need to be requested and the information recorded in the 'protocol' (for example 'Receiver') is the same - use a separate 'Activity' instance within this archetype for each request.  - If multiple services need to be requested and the information recorded in the 'protocol' (for example 'Receiver') is different - use a separate instance of this archetype for each request.    The 'Service due' data element supports common use cases for stipulating the simple timing for delivery of the request/s on a single occasion. For situations with more complicated timing requirements or a series of services, use the CLUSTER.service_direction archetype within the 'Complex timing' SLOT.    Implementation examples:  - Consider a clinician referring a patient to an Endocrinologist for diabetes treatment advice - the 'Service name will be 'Referral'; the 'Clinical indication' will be 'Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus'; the 'Reason for request' may be 'Difficulty controlling early evening hyperglycaemia; the 'Clinical context' may contain a narrative about the duration and previous management of their diabetes, current treatment, plus recent weight gain and information about the recent death of their spouse; current treatment; 'Intent' may be 'Second opinion' or 'Handover of care'.  - Consider a clinician ordering diabetes education - The 'Service name' will be 'Diabetes education'; the 'Clinical indication' will be 'Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus'; the 'Reason for request' may be 'New diagnosis' and 'Prevention of ketoacidosis'; and 'Clinical context' may be 'Newly diagnosed diabetic for initial education and instruction in insulin administration'. If delivery of the complete service requires more than one activity, such as 'four sessions at fortnightly intervals, commencing one week after discharge from hospital', use the CLUSTER.service_direction and associated CLUSTER.timing_nondaily archetype, nested within the 'Complex timing' SLOT.  - Consider a clinician ordering a meal home-delivery service from the municipal council - the 'Service name' may be 'Meals on wheels program'; the 'Clinical indication' may be 'Emphysema'; the 'Reason for request' may be 'Unable to shop or cook independently'. The complex timing for this requires the use of the CLUSTER.service_direction and associated CLUSTER.timing_nondaily archetype nested within the 'Complex timing' SLOT to define the delivery requirements such as 'daily for 6 months'.  - Consider a clinician ordering an ultrasound of the left leg to exclude a deep venous thrombosis - the 'Service name' will be 'Ultrasound left lower leg'; the 'Clinical indication' may be 'swollen left ankle'; the 'Reason for request' may be 'exclude DVT'; the 'Clinical context' may be 'gradually increasing pitting oedema to mid-calf in the left leg over the past 3 days'.  - Consider a clinician ordering a recurring blood test, such as an INR. The complex timing for this requires the use of the CLUSTER.service_direction and associated CLUSTER.timing_nondaily archetype nested within the 'Complex timing' SLOT to clearly define the frequency and timing for each sequence in a series of tests, such as 'daily for one week, weekly for 4 weeks, monthly for 6 months'.  - Consider a clinician ordering a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks. 'Follow-up appointment' will be the 'Service name'. If they enter '6 weeks' as the proposed timing for the appointment in the User Interface, the clinical system will record the date six weeks from today in the 'Service due' data element.    In many situations, it will be possible to record the steps that occur as part of this request being carried out using the corresponding generic ACTION.service. However, there will be many occasions where the required ACTION archetype will be very specific for purpose, as the data requirements for recording provision of many health-related services will need quite unique data elements, recording patterns or pathway steps. For example: ACTION.screening or ACTION.health_education.", "misuse": "Not to be used to record details about the activities that document how an order or request has been carried out - use an ACTION archetype for this purpose.

This archeype has deliberately been loosely modelled to be inclusive of the broadest range of adverse reactions, including but not limited to allergies, sensitivities, intolerances and side effects which warrant avoiding exposure to the identified substance.    Common use cases include, but are not limited to:  - Systematic questioning in any consultation, for example:  --- Allergy to penicilin? Yes, No, Unknown.  --- Reaction to sticking plasters? Yes, No, Unknown.    The semantics of this archetype are intentionally loose, and querying this archetype would normally only be useful or safe within the context of each specific template. In a template, each data element would usually be renamed to the specific question asked. Where value sets have been proposed for common use cases, these can be adapted for local use by using the DV_TEXT or the DV_BOOLEAN datatypes choice to match each specific use case.    The EVENT structure from the reference model can be used to specify whether the questions relate to point in time or over a period of time. Use a separate instance of this archetype to distinguish between a questionnaire recording information about a procedure that has been performed at any time in the past and information about a procedure performed within a specified time interval - for example the difference between \"Do you have influenza?\" compared to \"Have you had influenza in the past 4 weeks?\"    The source of the information in a questionnaire response may vary in different contexts but can be specifically identified using the 'Information provider' element in the Reference Model.    This archetype has been designed to be used as a screening tool or to record simple questionnaire-format data for use in situations such as a disease registry. If the screening questionnaire identifies the presence of a adverse reaction, it is recommended that clinical system record and persist the specific details about the adverse reaction (such as the date of clinical recognition) using the EVALUATION.adverse_reaction_risk archetype.", "misuse": "['Not to be used to record details about the presence or absence of a adverse reaction, outside of a screening context.

Developed by Cox JL, Holden JM and Sagovsky R 1987 (See references).    Internationally, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is the most widely accepted screening instrument used in the perinatal period. The EPDS was designed to allow screening of postnatal depression in the primary care setting1. It excludes some symptoms that are common in the perinatal period (tiredness, sleep disturbance, irritability) that other depression instruments include, as such symptoms do not differentiate between depressed and non-depressed postnatal women.    The value of the EPDS lies in the fact that it is easy to complete, has been validated in relation to other standardized psychiatric  measures and has been found to be acceptable to women who are asked to complete it. Its use provides women with the  opportunity to discuss their feelings and enables health professionals to discreetly raise the issue of postnatal depression.", "use": "As a screening instrument, the EPDS should only be used to assess a woman’s mood over the past seven (7) days. High scores  do not themselves confirm a depressive illness and, similarly, some women who score below a set threshold might have depression.  Thus, the EPDS does not provide a clinical diagnosis of depression and it should not be used as a substitute for full psychiatric  assessment or clinical judgement. Importantly the EPDS cannot be used to predict whether or not a respondent will experience  depression in the future - it can only be used to determine current mood.    There is consensus in the literature that women with scores  consistently ≥13 have a 60-100% probability of meeting diagnostic criteria for depression.", "misuse": "Should not be used to assess

This archetype has been designed to focus on the reporting of findings and interpretation associated with a single imaging examination (equivalent to a single DICOM study). References to DICOM-related attributes are included but the focus is on the representation of a clinical report from an imaging examination and not on representing DICOM-related attributes that might be expected within a radiology information system. Specific details about the DICOM series can be recorded using the CLUSTER.imaging_series nested within the 'Series details' SLOT.    Detailed findings observed during an imaging examination and targeting a specified structure or region can be recorded by nesting the CLUSTER.imaging_exam and/or its family of specialised archetypes within the 'Structured imaging findings' SLOT in this archetype. It is intended that over time the specific detail in each specialisation will grow to include findings using all imaging modalities.    If an imaging examination is carried out as part of a more complex activity, such as a surgical operation carried out under imaging guidance, the imaging findings should be recorded using this archetype.   Structured details about the surgical procedure and medications or contrast administered should be recorded using the ACTION.procedure and/or ACTION.medication archetypes, respectively. In this situation, it is recommended that all related archetypes should be reported within the same template.

This is typically done in a laboratory, but may be done in other environments such as at the point of care.    This archetype is intended to cover the result of a single ordered investigation where the specimen(s) are collected as a single procedure, and may include multiple analyte results or other components. Examples of this could include 'Full blood count', which would yield a separate analyte result for the count of each type of blood cell, or 'kidney biopsy non-neoplastic', which would yield findings from microscopy, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy.    This archetype has been designed to be a framework that will usually be extended with CLUSTER archetypes to enable appropriate recording of specific laboratory test result patterns. This includes, but is not limited to, tests for biochemistry, haematology, immunology and transfusion services etc and specific patterns for the unique requirements for microbiology and anatomical pathology. If the ordered tests or investigations do not commonly belong together in a named group or panel, each test result would normally be represented using separate instances of this archetype. There is, however, considerable variation in actual reporting/messaging practice and this archetype/related archetypes are designed to handle such variation.    This archetype supports multiple approaches to recording of specimen, reflecting current practice which varies enormously. A Laboratory test result has a high degree of alignment to an HL7 FHIR Diagnostic Report resource.    It is anticipated that one or more instances of this archetype, or archetype family, will be sent back to a requesting clinician within a laboratory report document comprising COMPOSITION.report_result archetype, or similar, and other relevant ENTRY archetypes.    The recording of confounding factors may be inconsistent, often depending on the analysing laboratory and on clinical information sent by the requester. In the State section of the archetype there is a simple 'Confounding factors' data element that is optional and can be repeated as one way to record a variety of simple factors that need to be made explicit as they may influence interpretation of the results. If the confounding factors are more complex, it may be appropriate to create a local/shared CLUSTER archetype that can be nested in the 'Confounding factors details' SLOT.   Note 1: Known or required pre-conditions, such as 'fasting' or 'Day 1 of menstrual cycle', should be reported in the 'Sampling conditions' data element in the CLUSTER.specimen archetype, nested within this OBSERVATION archetype.  Note 2: Known issues with specimen collection or handling, such as 'sample haemolysed' or 'prolonged use of tourniquet' should be reported within 'Specimen quality' in the CLUSTER.specimen archetype, nested within this OBSERVATION archetype.    Where 'reflex tests' are performed by the laboratory, these may be handled as per US/FHIR guidance (see https://www.hl7.org/fhir/2015may/uslabreport-guide.html) or other local policy. For example, one of the following ...  1. Record the reflex test results additional 'Test findings' within the same 'openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.laboratory_test_result'  2. Record the reflex test results as 'Test findings' within a new 'openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.laboratory_test_result' but refer to the original lab test request via 'Test request details'.  3. Record the reflex test results as 'Test findings' within a new 'openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.laboratory_test_result' but reference a new lab test request as well as the original lab test request via 'Test request details'.", "misuse": "Not to be used to record an Autopsy or a Forensic report, although tests on some specimens that are taken in such situations may be represented using this archetype.

Yes, No, Unknown.  --- Have you been using any anticoagulants the last four weeks? Yes, No, Unknown.    The semantics of this archetype are intentionally loose, and querying this archetype would normally only be useful or safe within the context of each specific template. In a template, each data element would usually be renamed to the specific question asked. Where value sets have been proposed for common use cases, these can be adapted for local use by using the DV_TEXT or the DV_BOOLEAN datatypes choice to match each specific use case.    The EVENT structure from the reference model can be used to specify whether the questions relate to point in time or over a period of time. Use a separate instance of this archetype to distinguish between a questionnaire recording information about a medication that has been used at any time in the past and information about a medication used within a specified time interval - for example the difference between \"Do you use paracetamol?\" compared to \"Have you been using any anticoagulants during the last four weeks?\".    The source of the information in a questionnaire response may vary in different contexts but can be specifically identified using the 'Information provider' element in the Reference Model.    This archetype has been designed to be used as a screening tool or to record simple questionnaire-format data for use in situations such as a disease registry. If the screening questionnaire identifies the presence of a medication it is recommended that clinical system record and persist the specific details about the medication using a relevant medication archetype, for example the OBSERVATION.medication_statement to record a detailed snapshot view about the actual use of a single specified medication.", "misuse": "['Not to be used for recording an order for a medication to be administered or consumed - use INSTRUCTION.medication_order for this purpose.

Common use cases include, but are not limited to:  - Specific questioning about previous procedures before admission to a hospital.  - Systematic questioning in any consultation, for example:  --- Have you ever had an appendectomy? Yes, No, Unknown.  --- Have you had a hip or knee replacement in the past twelve months? Yes, No, Unknown.    The semantics of this archetype are intentionally loose, and querying this archetype would normally only be useful or safe within the context of each specific template. In a template, each data element would usually be renamed to the specific question asked. Where value sets have been proposed for common use cases, these can be adapted for local use by using the DV_TEXT or the DV_BOOLEAN datatypes choice to match each specific use case.    The EVENT structure from the reference model can be used to specify whether the questions relate to point in time or over a period of time. Use a separate instance of this archetype to distinguish between a questionnaire recording information about a procedure that has been performed at any time in the past and information about a procedure performed within a specified time interval - for example the difference between \"Have you ever had any hip or knee surgery?\" compared to \"Have you had any hip or knee surgery in the last 12 months?    The source of the information in a questionnaire response may vary in different contexts but can be specifically identified using the 'Information provider' element in the Reference Model.    This archetype has been designed to be used as a screening tool or to record simple questionnaire-format data for use in situations such as a disease registry.

This archetype represents the relevant data points separately: firstly establishing 'Regular' vs 'Irregular' and then, if 'Irregular', further options of 'Regularly irregular' and 'Irregularly irregular'. In practice, clinical systems could offer users a combination of the values from the 'Regularity' and 'Irregular type' - for example, 'Regular', 'Regularly irregular' and 'Irregularly irregular' drawn from these two data elements. Data could be recorded against both data elements with the assumption that if one of the irregular types are selected, then the 'Irregular' value in the 'Regularity' data element is also automatically selected.    In certain situations it is important to be very specific so that a rate observed at a peripheral body site, such as the radial artery, can be differentiated from the rate of the heart. To record a pulse deficit, record the measurements of the mechanical heart rate and a peripheral pulse rate in two instances of this archetype - the difference between these measurments is the pulse deficit. The actual pulse deficit will be recorded in a separate OBSERVATION archetype.", "misuse": "Not to be used to record the R-R rate in the context of an Electrocardiograph report - use the OBSERVATION.ecg archetype for this purpose.    Not to be used to record other details of the full cardiovascular examination or assessment. Other specific CLUSTER archetypes will be used to record characteristics such as apex beat, murmurs and bruits, or auscultatory findings.    In particular, this archetype is not intended to record the assessment of peripheral vascular disease, which requires documentation of the presence and strength of each peripheral pulse. A specific CLUSTER archetype will be used to record the general findings on examination of peripheral pulses.     Not to be used to record fetal heart rate - use the OBSERVATION.fetal_heart archetype for this purpose.

If additional information about body temperature, ambient pressure or humidity is required, this can be recorded using additional archetypes. Body temperature can be recorded using an instance of the OBSERVATION.body_temperature archetype committed within the same COMPOSITION. Ambient pressure or humidity can be recorded using the CLUSTER.environmental_conditions in the 'Enviromental conditions' slot.    The 'Any event' can be cloned and constrained to support the representation of:  - Multiple measurements and their average - clone the 'Any event' as many times as needed, plus an additional event set to 'Interval' and selecting the 'Mean' attribute;  - Pre- and post bronchial challenge or bronchodilator results - clone the 'Any event' and rename as 'Baseline' and 'Post challenge/bronchodilator', associated with a time offset if required.", "misuse": "Not to be used to record the results of other types of lung function tests, for example body plethysmography or lung diffusion tests.

Details of what was administered should be recorded using an instance of the ACTION.medication archetype committed within the same COMPOSITION.    If additional information about body temperature, ambient pressure or humidity is required, this can be recorded using additional archetypes. Body temperature can be recorded using an instance of the OBSERVATION.body_temperature archetype committed within the same COMPOSITION. Ambient pressure or humidity can be recorded using the CLUSTER.environmental_conditions in the 'Enviromental conditions' slot.    The 'Any event' can be cloned and constrained to support the representation of:  - Multiple measurements and their average - clone the 'Any event' as many times as needed, plus an additional event set to 'Interval' and selecting the 'Mean' attribute;  - Pre- and post bronchial challenge or bronchodilator results - clone the 'Any event' and rename as 'Baseline' and 'Post challenge/bronchodilator', associated with a time offset if required.", "misuse": "Not to be used to record the results of other types of lung function tests, for example body plethysmography or lung diffusion tests.

This archetype is intended to be used within the COMPOSITION.problem_list or as one component of other COMPOSITION archetypes. For example: complex documents, such as a discharge summary or referral.    This list can be comprised of three types of statements, each represented by specific archetypes:  - statements about the positive presence of problems, diagnoses or previous procedures are recorded using the EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis and/or ACTION.procedure archetypes; OR  - statements about the positive exclusion of problems, diagnoses or previous procedures can be recorded using the specific EVALUATION.exclusion_global archetype - for example: 'No significant problems or diagnoses' and/or 'No history of significant operations or procedures'; OR  - statements about no information being available - neither a positive presence of a problem, diagnosis or procedure performed nor a positive exclusion - can be recorded using the EVALUATION.absence archetype.    While it may be ideal to have only one Problem list for each subject of care, it is more realistic to expect that in a distributed environment, multiple Problem lists for a single individual may coexist, each managed and prioritised for a specific clinician, episode of care or other context. For example, a Problem list for a primary care clinician may be a very different configuration to that which is useful for a specialist surgeon or for reference during a hospital inpatient episode. In primary care it is common to organise the Problem list based on active or inactive problems or diagnoses; specialists may prefer to see their list organised around primary diagnoses which are related to their specific speciality and secondary ones which are not; an inpatient admission may include additional issues related to immediate nursing priorities that would not be relevant once discharged home. For these purposes, the CLUSTER.problem_qualifier archetype, nested within the Status SLOT in the Problem/Diagnosis archetype supports the use of qualifiers that will supprt clinical systems to organise Problem lists according to the preference of the clinical users of the system, without perpetuating these contextual status labels to other clinical scenarios or for persistence.
